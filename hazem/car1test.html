                    <p>
                        The 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan is the flagship of the brand's electrified future
                        and one of the fanciest EVs ever. We even named it to our 2022 Editors' Choice
                        list. Its curvaceous body effortlessly slips through the air for maximum efficiency,
                        and its palatial cabin boasts luxurious appointments and state-of-the-art features
                        for the all-important wow factor. That's made most obvious by the optional glass-
                        covered Hyperscreen dashboard. The sizable EV sedan is offered with a 329-hp,
                        rear-drive powertrain (EQS450+) or a 516-hp, all-wheel-drive setup (EQS580
                        4Matic). Both utilize a large 107.8-kWh battery that's rated at up to 350 miles of
                        range. While calling the 2022 EQS an electrifying luxury car is an easy pun, it's
                        also entirely accurate.
